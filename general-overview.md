## General Overview
For this homework, you will take the outline that you created in the previous assignment and work with a partner (optionally) to create the basic information you will need for the website that you will create as the final project for this section of the course.  For this unit you will need to write the website content, select images, create metadata, and generally plan out the concept and content that will be the basis of your website. 

You can choose any topic or idea for your website that combines historical, technical, and/or information about companies that relate to the history and technology of the Internet. You will need to use Git and GitHub to collaborate and Markdown as the syntax for your content, so you don't need to use any HTML yet. The more thought and time you put into this, the better your project will come out. You should think about the overall concept of your website and the audience you intend to serve i.e. children, teens, adults, etc... This is a lot of work and I'm forcing you to collaborate with another person since the only way to learn Git  is to have to use it to work with someone else. It is much easier to learn GIT with just using plain text; rather than trying to learn it, while you are learning to code.

## Technical Challenge - Major Requirement
The technical challenge of this assignment is that you must use GIT and GitHub to collaborate. The module content videos show you how to work with a partner. You must create a readme.MD file and have the contents of this file visible on the homepage of your repository on GitHub. You must submit a link to this repository for this assignment. You can and should create more pages than a ReadMe file and link them together using Markdown syntax. If you run into something you don't understand, you should ask in the general channel in Slack. Don't be afraid of asking, since most of your classmates are learning this for the first time too and it can be a bit complicated when you first get started.

## Qualitative and Informational Challenges
You will need to read the articles at the bottom of this page to develop an understanding of what you will be required for your website. This is not a web design course; however, you can learn the basics fairly quickly and this will help you produce a better project as well as improve your ability to use the web to communicate. 
  
 
 
## Visual Design 
You will be using the F and Z layouts for your website, so you need to plan your outline and content to more or less match what you will need for the website. The F and Z layouts can be used for different pages within the same website, so for example the F layout is often used for text-heavy pages, while the Z layout is used for a homepage or other page where imagery and action are the focus of the page.

## Content
You are required to write content for your website. These two articles explain hero text (main topic headline for home page) and general tips for writing content for the web.

## Images
Alt attributes on image links are to help the visually impaired and are usually required for most websites made for government, corporations, and search engine optimization. For more on alt attributes see this article (Links to an external site.).

## Markdown
You need to develop your content using Markdown, so you will need to know the syntax. This covers the basic syntax and should be all you need to create your readme.MD file and other pages for the required content.

## Web page Metadata
Metadata required for each web page: [seo 101 everything you need to know about metadata](https://itseeze.com/blog/seo-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-metadata/) (Links to an external site.)
 
You will need to have this basic information included in your website outline/content, so you have it available when you go to make the website.
General Info
You and your partner's name if applicable.

### Deliverables: 
Link Git Repository with the requested information visible / linked to in the readme.MD file on the homepage.
Collaboration: not required and you should only work with one other person. Do not make it more complicated by having 3 or more.
You need to have a partner or you can create 2 GitHub accounts and switch between them to simulate having a partner. You can switch between 2 accounts fairly easily if you log in to GitHub with 2 different browsers i.e. Chrome and Firefox. This is because the authentication/login session is between the browser and the webserver. It is a lot better to learn git first individually and then try to collaborate with someone.  
 
 
### Some instructions from the professor:
- the intent of this unit is to make you work to come to a common document and use GIT to collaborate.
 
- It is easier to learn git while your editing plain text than if you have to learn it while coding.
 
- you can use GIT right in the browser on github or you can do it any other way you want.
 
- When we are writing code we will use it through our code editor VScode.
 
- The best way to learn GIT is to get the basic concepts using it through the browser on GitHub like i show you in the videos; however, you will need to learn to use it through the command line and within your code editor to really know it and be able to put it on your resume
 
- you will be using GIT from now on in the course, so you will have lots of opportunities to practice
 
 
- You first need to learn GIT on your own through the video and the interactive tutorial I posted in the unit content
 
then you need to work with someone to figure out how your going to produce what i'm asking for
 
make sure you read this because i'm not kidding around
